# Information

This website provides ideal teams to master the Territory Battle `Rise of the Empire` in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes with as little effort as possible. I try to recommend only teams, which are able to full auto battles without any Omicrons, where possible.

The information is based on a combination of personal experience by myself and my guild, as well as the websites [https://www.swgohrote.com/](https://www.swgohrote.com/) and [https://genskaar.github.io/tb_empire/](https://genskaar.github.io/tb_empire/).

The major contribution I am bringing is providing a recommendation of teams to use without any overlap per phase. This way is able to easily loop up teams t clear a full phase or get an idea on which teams to build up.

In the cases where alternatives are mention, you will be able to find them on the above mentioned websites.
